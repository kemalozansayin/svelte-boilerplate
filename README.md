Welcome my developer friend! :wave:

:soon: BOILERPLATE IS ON THE WAY: UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

Feel free to use this challenging vanilla [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) boilerplate for developing web applications or
websites with svelte.

What will you have after development, please continue reading:

- This boilerplate will develop with atomic design principles.
- All files will have required explanations as comments.
- You will have a detailed documentation guide.
- You will have a Layout and Router Provider to easy routing and layouting.
- Easy mixin classes with tailwindCSS,
- Modular folder structure.

This boilerplate is developing with coffee,love,passion, and my style, but no worries; be sure, you will love this!

See you in a near future my precious colleague. :bouquet:
